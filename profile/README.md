# SIMATIC AX Community

We believe that collaboration helps everybody to create better products and services, which ultimately makes our world a better place. We made it our mission to provide you with such a space to grow together. **This space is here!**

## Limited access

The community is private, but we plan to open it up more over time.
Please follow this organization to indicate you're interested in getting access. We'll reach out to you once we accept new members.
